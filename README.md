MNIST Digit Detection

This repository contains a project focused on detecting handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using multiple machine learning algorithms.

Overview
The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks, particularly for digit recognition. In this project, I have implemented various machine learning models to classify digits from 0 to 9. The project demonstrates the use of different algorithms and compares their performance based on accuracy and speed.

Algorithms Used
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Networks (NN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Each of these models was trained and evaluated using the MNIST dataset, and the results were compared to assess the effectiveness of each algorithm.
